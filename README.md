## Introduction
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer 'thinks' of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

I had two main goals for this project. First, I wanted to implement a simple program in Python while adhering to best practices like PEP8 style guidelines and object-oriented programming principles. Second, I aimed to gain familiarity with Git and GitHub by learning common commands like committing, pushing, and pulling changes, creating README files, and leveraging other key features of the platforms.

## File Structure
The final product of the project is contained within hangmanGame.py. The milestone files represent incremental stages of its completion; the hangmanGame.py file would work just the same if all of the milestone files were removed.
